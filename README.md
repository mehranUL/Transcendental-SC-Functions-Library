This work introduces a hardware-efficient design methodology for low-cost implementation of transcendental functions using Stochastic Computing (SC). 
Our methodology enjoys the strengths of quasi-random sequences. 
The proposed approach eliminates the need for decorrelators, reducing hardware cost and latency while achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
The proposed approach can improve area, power, and energy consumption by up to 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively, while providing a higher or comparable accuracy compared to the SOTA SC designs.
